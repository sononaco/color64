Color64 BBS web clone

This is a web conversion of the Color64 BBS for Commodore computers.

This is very much a work in progress! Any help is appreciated. 
It is my goal to get this functioning exactly like the original Color64 BBS.

It is written entirely using jQuery, HTML and PHP with the awesome jQuery Terminal plugin by Jakub Jankiewicz

Update 8-Aug-2012: Got logoff somewhat working. It looks like it works but does nothing but freezes the terminal requiring you to log back in. So I guess it does work. [R]ead messages is still getting there. Update 5-Aug-2012: Login is fixed. You can now read messages and view the menu. Process has started on [r]eading messages. Any help is appreciated.

If you would like to contribute to this project please contact me at sysop@color64.com

What will it do? Not much for now. You can register, login, get a membership list, get the main menu. That's about it.
